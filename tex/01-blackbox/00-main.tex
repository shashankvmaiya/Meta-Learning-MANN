\section*{Data Processing and Black-Box Meta-Learning}

\textbf{Goals:} In this assignment, we will look at meta-learning for few shot classification. You will:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn how to process and partition data for meta learning problems, where training is done over a distribution of training tasks $p(\mathcal{T})$.
    \item Implement and train memory augmented neural networks, a black-box meta-learner that uses a recurrent neural network \cite{pmlr-v48-santoro16}.
    \item Analyze the learning performance for different size problems.
    \item Experiment with model parameters and explore how they improve performance.
\end{enumerate}

We will be working with Omniglot~\cite{Lake1332}, a dataset with 1623 characters from 50 different languages. Each character has 20 28x28 images.
We are interested in training models for $K$-shot, $N$-way classification, i.e. training a classifier to distinguish between $N$ previously unseen characters, given only $K$ labeled examples of each character.
